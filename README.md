# pop-it-game

[Pop it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_it_(toy)) is a fidget toy which became popular in the beginning of 2021 due to TikTok.

The game is simple and has the following ruleset:

<ol>
  <li> Decide who start </li>
  <li> Choose a row and choose the number of cells you want to pop (from 1 to the entire row) </li>
  <li> Opponent does the same </li>
  <li> Whoever has to pop the last unpopped cell, loses! </li>
</ol>

This can be regarded as a version of the game of Nim.

I made a small web-app in which you can play against the algorithm and try to win :-)
